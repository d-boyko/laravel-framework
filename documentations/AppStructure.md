    A --> H[Http] --> C1[Controllers<br>Processing display, create, update, and delete requests]
    H --> C2[Middleware<br>MIDDLEWARE IS AN INTERMEDIATE LAYER BETWEEN THE INCOMING REQUEST AND THE CONTROLLER<br>You can record logs, add cookies to the response, etc.<br>Authenticate - the user is logged in or not logged in<br>EncryptCookies - when a request with cookies arrives in our application - it decrypts them, and at the output - encrypts<br>PreventRequestsDuringMaintenance - is our application in maintenance mode under any in the request<br>php artisan down - enables the service mode<br>RedirectIfAuthenticated - if the user is already logged in - throws to the personal account<br>TrimStrings - if the registration form was sent, it may be that the user sent an email with a space at the end<br>TrustHosts - hosts with which the application will interact<br>TrustProxies - the load balancer server distributes all requests equally to the application servers<br>VerifyCsrfToken - protection against Csrf attacks. This is a forgery of cross-site requests. It must be observed when using the POST, PUT, DELETE forms]
    H --> C3[Requests<br>Another form for validation rules. In order not to write validation logic in the controller, we can create a separate class, <br> in which the validation rules will be listed in the rules method]

    A --> R[Rules<br>You can set additional validation rules, which we can then use in the controller or in Requests]
